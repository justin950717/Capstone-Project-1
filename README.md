# Capstone---Case-Study-1

The following R code was done on RStudio in order to clean, analyze and visualize a summary dataset; created for my capstone project as part of the "Google Data Analytics Certificate" Course. The case study for my capstone project is regarding different types of bike-sharing user (members & casual users) patterns in Chicago, US by Cyclists company.
